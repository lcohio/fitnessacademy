                <p class="CF2__pitch">"Tell's programming and training has helped me lose over 50lb and counting. He has really helped fix my form by breaking down my lifts
                        through videos and telling me where I can improve. Most importantly, he has taught me lifestyle changes that have improved my overall health." -Seth

                <p class="CF2__letter-greeting">What's up Homie!</p>
                <p class="CF2__letter">My name is Tell Fisher, and if you're interested in leveling up your fitness journey, being in the best shape of your life, being bigger, 
                        leaner and stronger than you've ever been, having high and sustainable levels of energy and ultimately learning everything there is to know about the 
                        fitness lifestyle, then The Online Fitness Academy is for YOU.<br><br> A quick story about me:<br><br>When I started lifting I was 120lb on a good day. At 5'5 I was 
                        always the shortest and smallest guy in the room.<br><br>I basically started lifting just to look better, feel better and gain confidence in myself.<br><br>
                        As a result, I've been able to build over 40 pounds onto my frame, be in the best shape of my life, feel the most confident I've ever felt!<br><br>
                </p>
                <img class="CF2__image" src="images/before after 2-min.jpg" alt="Before and after">
                <p class="CF2__pitch__2">Anyways, along the way I messed up a lot, learned mistakes the hard way and left a ton of progress and gainz on the table.<br><br>
                        I didn't know how to eat properly, I had no idea how to lift safely and efficiently, I didn't know there was GOOD and BAD workout programs,
                        I really just didn't know what things I needed to focus on to live the fitness lifestyle.<br><br>
                        So I decided it was time I put together a 12 week program, where I teach lifters everything they need to know about the fitness lifestyle.
                        As a result, The Online Fitness Academy was founded!

                <p class="CF2__testimonial">"As a guy pushing 50 that's active and does manual labor I reached out to this guy for some programming help. Didn't know him at all but he responded quickly and has been the best help I've ever had! Fixed my deadlift with one video. No bull approach with a tough but sustainable workout that's going to take me to the best fitness level of my life! Thanks Tell" -Steve</p>
                <p class="CF2__testimonial">"Yo Tell just a quick shoutout about the program you've got me on! Best program I've ever used for sure and the 4 days of lifting gives me time to do cardio on my off days. Keep killin' it fam!" -Taylor</p>
                <p class="CF2__testimonial">"I gained 10lb of muscle mass in the first month of your program, I was very surprised with the results and was very thankful for your helpfulness in teaching me so much." -Preston</p>
                <p class="CF2__testimonial">"Tell's programming and training has helped me lose over 40lb and counting. This is through working with me as a new lifter and showing me the correct form. He has really helped fix my form by breaking down my lifts lifts through videos and telling me where I can improve. Most importantly, he has taught me lifestyle changes that have improved my overall health." -Seth</p>
                <p class="CF2__testimonial">"Got a workout program that was tailored to my exact goals and needs as an older gentleman. Was thorough and provided clear directions and progression that is easy to follow. Well thought out and not some copy and paste workout plan." -Chief</p>
                <p class="CF2__testimonial">Personally, (Tell) I've built over 40lb onto my frame over the past couple of years. My Squat went from 115lb to 365lb. My Bench went from 60lb to 235lb. My Deadlift went from 115lb to 425lb. All of this has been achieved at 5'5 and 160lb bodyweight.</p>
